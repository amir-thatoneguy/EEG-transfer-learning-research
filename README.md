# EEG-transfer-learning

## Introduction: 
This is some of the stuff I did as a junior researcher working on transfer learning for EEG signals as my final bachelor's project. My project included reviewing recent papers on transfer learning, giving short lectures and presentations on my project, and implementing research papers and some of my own ideas. The structure of this repository is as follows:

### Presentations Folder
These are the (many!) presentations I gave to my classmates and other interested researchers. I changed my focus many times over the course of about a year I was working on this project, and the presentation topics included many interesting ideas I learned about. 

### List of Papers
This is a list of some of the papers related to my project. I either reviewed or reimplemented the ideas of these papers for my project.

### Code Notebooks
This notebook includes some of my experiments and implementations for this project. I did many experiments, many of which didn't work or were not as promising as I'd hoped.


### Ideas and What I Learned
This includes some of my own ideas for transfer learning on EEG signals and some of the lessons I learned along the way.
